# Mercer Motors


# Please note that since this has been marked by my lecturer, I have swapped out the higher spec server this was hosted on for a lower spec (cheaper) one. This site is still accessible, but the server will go to sleep if no visitors are detected after a certain period of time. If you go to the site and it doesn't load as you'd expect it to, please give 10-15 seconds for the server to spin up, and then you can access it as you normally would.




## This was a coursework project for the 'Business Systems' module
Mercer Motors is an e-commerce based dynamic website for buying and selling second hand cars. The basic flow is that users can register, and list cars, they can also buy cars that have been listed by other users.
